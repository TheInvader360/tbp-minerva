===========

This Play Framework (1.2.5) application is a small demo app I created to help me get to grips with Play and Bootstrap.

The product and sales data is all nonsense, so don't read anything into the canned data values.

If you find this app to be a useful learning tool, please check out [www.thebookpeople.co.uk](http://www.thebookpeople.co.uk) and buy some books - we offer unbeatable value :)
